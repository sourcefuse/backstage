# jenkins-with-reporting-backend

Welcome to the jenkins-with-reporting-backend backend plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

This backend plugin is created to to fetch the jenkins builds, details, reports generated.

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/jenkins-with-reporting-backend/health](http://localhost:7007/api/jenkins-with-reporting-backend/health).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
